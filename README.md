# Description: 
This is a fullstack application utilizing Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars template, and REST server database.

# Proposal:

Ever been in a situation where feel like you have nothing in the fridge? Now you can see if you can make something out of your leftovers or use those soon to be expired ingredients. For example, if you have leftover rice and chicken, type those ingredients in and you will see different dishes, such as, chicken fried rice or a latin inspired chicken bowl.


# User Story:

As a user with little to no culinary knowledge, I want to find a recipe or recipes with some ingredients I have laying around the house. I want to see what other dishes I could make that I normally would not think of doing.
