Ever been in a situation where feel like you have nothing in the fridge? Now you can see if you can make something out of your leftovers or use those soon to be expired ingredients. For example, if you have leftover rice and chicken, type those ingredients in and you will see different dishes, such as, chicken fried rice or a latin inspired chicken bowl.
